# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses a set of registers to divide the clock, and then some combinational logic
      to convert from binary to decimal for the display.

      It will start to increment a declared signal, by changing the signal, 
      it will change a decoder, so that a 7-segment display 
      will show each letter of the word, with a waiting time of one second.

      Each change in the display will be made with a one-second timeout that is being manipulated 
      with a 10 MHz clock frequency.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After resetting and setting a switch to high state, for every second that elapses, 
      the display will show each letter of the word. After displaying the last letter, it will restart the first letter of the word.
